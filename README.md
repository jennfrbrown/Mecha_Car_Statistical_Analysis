## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?
  The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10 <sup>-11, wich is much smaller that an our assumed significance of 0.05%.  Therefore, we can state that there is significant evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
  
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
